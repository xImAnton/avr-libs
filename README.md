# avrstuff
random programs that i coded for an atmega8

## main.c
Testing file for the program that I currently build. May change over time.
If I build something useful, it will be copied over to a separate file and I will provide a circiut diagram.

## libavr.h
Small lib for abstraction of port and pin byte operations.

## libshift.h
Library for dealing with shift registers.

## Goal
I'm doing this to get familiar with microcontroller and low level programming.
The big goal is for me to create a device with an Atmega8 that lets you control a LED lightstrip from your computer via USB.
